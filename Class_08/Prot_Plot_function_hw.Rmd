##Function to plot protein given a user-inputed protein name

```{r}
prot_plot <- function(prot_name){
  
  #Reads in user-inputed  protein name from database
  prot1 <- read.pdb(prot_name)
  
  #creates subset of atoms, containing just the A chain of 
  prot1.chainA <- trim.pdb(prot1, chain = "A", elety = "CA")
  
  #Select subset of atoms to compare
  prot1.b <- prot1.chainA$atom$b
  
  ##Outputs the line plot for effect of drug binding
  #Graph compares Bfactor and Residue

}
```

##Call prot_plot() function on protein "4AKE"


```{r}
